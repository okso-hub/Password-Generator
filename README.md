# Password Generator

To run this program, direct to the directory where the `main.py` file is stored and run it using the command `python main.py`

You will be asked to enter the length of the password which should be generated.

```
Enter the length of the password 
```

Let's say our password should be nine characters long.

```
Enter the length of the password 9
```

Then the program will generate a password with eight random characters.

Your password is NitA"Er=S
